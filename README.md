# US Accidents Data Analysis & Visualization
Analyze US accident data to discover patterns related to weather conditions, road features, and time of day.
Visualize accident hotspots using interactive heatmaps and explore factors that contribute to traffic accidents.

 Project Overview
Goal: Identify patterns in accidents based on time, weather, and road conditions, and visualize hotspots.
Dataset: US_Accidents_March23.csv

# Main steps:
1) Data exploration and preprocessing
2) Visualize accidents by hour of day
3) Analyze top weather conditions involved in accidents
4) Examine impact of road features like junctions, bumps, and traffic signals
5) Create an interactive accident hotspots map

# Technologies & Libraries
1) Python 🐍
2) pandas
3) matplotlib
4) seaborn
5) folium (for heatmap visualization)

# Project Workflow
✅ Step 1: Import libraries
Import required libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

📂 Step 2: Load dataset
Read the accident dataset and explore basic statistics and data types.

🛠 Step 3: Data preprocessing
Convert Start_Time to datetime
Handle missing data
Extract hour from Start_Time to analyze hourly accident trends

⏰ Step 4: Accidents by hour
Visualize how accident frequency varies across different hours of the day.

🌧 Step 5: Weather condition analysis
Identify and plot the top 10 weather conditions associated with the highest number of accidents.

🚦 Step 6: Road feature analysis
Analyze how features like bumps, junctions, traffic signals, stops, and crossings impact accident counts.

🗺 Step 7: Accident hotspot map
Use Folium HeatMap to plot accident locations and visualize geographical hotspots.

# Results & Insights
1) Accidents are more frequent during peak commuting hours.
2) Certain weather conditions like rain and fog contribute to higher accident counts.
3) Road features such as junctions and traffic signals show a significant association with accidents.
4) The interactive heatmap highlights accident-dense regions in the US.
